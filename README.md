This repository documents my 15-day learning sprint where I:
- Learn Git & GitHub by using them daily
- Build projects
- Move toward building software + hardware systems

## Structure
- Each project has its own folder
- Projects may span multiple days
- Daily progress is documented in this README

## Day 1 — Git & First CLI Tool
- Set up Git and GitHub
- Learned core Git concepts (init, add, commit, push, origin, main)
- Built a simple python CLI greeting tool
- Learned about the usage of `if __name__ == "__main__"`
