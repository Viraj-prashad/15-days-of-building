### 15 Days of Building ###

This repository documents my 15-day learning sprint where I:
- Learn Git & GitHub by using them daily
- Build Python projects
- Move toward software + hardware systems

## Structure
- Each day has its own folder for code
- Each day has a short reflection file

## Day 1 — Git & First CLI Tool
- Set up Git and GitHub
- Learned core Git concepts (init, add, commit, push, origin, main)
- Built a simple python CLI greeting tool
